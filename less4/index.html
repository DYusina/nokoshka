            <div class="descr">Within a culture, memes can take a variety of forms, such as an idea, a skill, a behaviour, a phrase, or a particular fashion. The replication and transmission of a meme occurs when one person copies a unit of cultural information comprising a meme from another person. The process of transmission is carried out primarily by means of verbal, visual, or electronic communication, ranging from books and conversation to television, e-mail, or the Internet. Those memes that are most successful in being copied and transmitted become the most prevalent within a culture.</div>

            <div class="subtext">It has become a cultural thing. Even elder generations want to understand these jokes.</div>
            <div class="subtext">Memes are addictive. They show true human emotions. You can have a dialogue consisting only of memes when properly educated on the topic</div>
